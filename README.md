# Review the React Frontend

- Review how the state is managed and how the components interact.
- Look for potential performance issues (e.g., re-renders) and code quality concerns.
- Assess the overall structure and organization of the components.

## Documentation

- Provide a detailed review document that identifies issues, potential improvements, and any concerns with the current implementation.
- Suggest refactoring or design changes where necessary.
